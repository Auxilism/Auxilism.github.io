            What are Hexa Stats?
        </h5>
        <p>
            Hexa Stats are part of the Sixth job advancement that came in Nov 2023 (GMS).<br>
            There is a page from the KMS wiki on Hexa Stats: <a href="https://en.namu.wiki/w/HEXA%20%EB%A7%A4%ED%8A%B8%EB%A6%AD%EC%8A%A4#s-2.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.namu.wiki/w/HEXA%20%EB%A7%A4%ED%8A%B8%EB%A6%AD%EC%8A%A4#s-2.2</a><br>
            Kobe also did a video on Hexa Stats: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7bmPlch6o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7bmPlch6o8</a><br>

            How much would it take to reach x level on main stat?
        </h5>
        <p>
            The page from the KMS wiki on Hexa Stats addresses this: <a href="https://en.namu.wiki/w/HEXA%20%EB%A7%A4%ED%8A%B8%EB%A6%AD%EC%8A%A4#s-2.2.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.namu.wiki/w/HEXA%20%EB%A7%A4%ED%8A%B8%EB%A6%AD%EC%8A%A4#s-2.2.1</a><br>
            Hence I do not currently feel the need to add this calculation/simulation in.<br>

            18 Aug 2024:
            <ul>
                <li>Added simulation and optimisation for multiple nodes.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Although only the second stat node is released in kms, I am using the same logic for the future 3-6th stat nodes where the previous nodes must be at max level (20).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Removed comparing stat nodes since that doesn't work well with multiple nodes, and the FD is from the whole group rather than a single node.
                </li>
            </ul>
            11 Dec 2023:
            <ul>
                <li>Added FD% statistics alongside the ratios.</li>
                <li>Added more to FAQ and tasks section.</li>
            </ul>
            10 Dec 2023:

        <h5>
            Known but not doing:
        </h4>
        <ol>
            <h6>
                <li>
                    Add an option to input the actual stat values for each type (att/stat/crit dmg/boss dmg/dmg/ied) and calculate their FD% per unit from that.
                </li>
            </h6>
            <p>
                I'll admit that I didn't think about this until it was raised as a suggestion. However, after pondering about it, I don't think it would be that straightforward as it sounds:
                <ul>
                    <li>Total secondary stat would be needed as well, since that is factored into the 'stat value' for damage output.</li>
                    <li>Additional inputs from the user would be needed for Xenon and DA since their stat formulas are different. This would also make this calculator unable to support a class with a totally new formula until implemented.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the input would have to be when fully buffed, e.g. gskills, potions, fams, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                So I'm not really talking about the logic to implement, but more so that users would have to prepare more to input more fields.
                Using the generic calculator <a href="http://tiny.cc/maplestorycalculators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linked</a> would save those fields upon reopening, but this webpage would need users to input everything again.<br>
                Hence I don't think I'll ever implement it.
            </p>
                <li>
                    Make a better UI.
                </li>
            </h6>
            <p>
                I'm just lazy to learn more about frontend at this point of time.<br>
                This repository is open source, so if somebody wants to make a pull request I would be open to merging it.

            Explanations:
        </h2>
            <p>
                These are here for people to check my logic so that if I am operating on wrong assumptions, they can be corrected.

        <h5>
            How the FD% is calculated for a stat type given 1 unit of FD%:
        </h5>
        <p>
            With ied being one source, every stat type increases the FD% they give linearly. So after getting the number of units the stat levels would give, multiply that by the FD% per unit input. 
        </p>
        <h5>
            How the FD% is calculated for all the stat nodes:
        </h5>
        <p>
            Other than boss dmg and dmg being additive with each other, every other stat (att, stat, crit dmg, ied) is independent of each other. After adding the FD% of boss damage and damage, everything can be multiplied with each other.
        </p>
        <h5>
            The decision to split up FD% for boss dmg and dmg, instead of just multiplying boss dmg's FD% by 0.75 for dmg:
        </h5>
        <p>
            The math would work out if we consider only calculating for hitting against bosses. But I wanted to keep it open for if people wanted to optimise for mobbing so they can put 0 FD% for boss dmg, while dmg still having some value.
        </p>

            Format is heavily inspired by SuckHard's calculators. Example: <a href="https://brendonmay.github.io/starforceCalculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://brendonmay.github.io/starforceCalculator/</a><br>
            Also thank you to them for confirming that I can look at the original UI code and which library to use, it really helped me to get a working UI.<br>
            It still looks very basic, because of my own decision to not think too much on the frontend.<br>
